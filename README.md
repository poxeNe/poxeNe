### hi there ðŸ‘‹

my name is taylor, and i try to build cool things with code!

i started coding initially at the beginning of 2021, but fell off of it after hitting my first big snag after a couple of months (managing game state through saves/loads really messed with my head at the time, haha). since then, i've come a long way in understanding that being stuck is only temporary, whether it's with code or anything else, and that i'll eventually wrap my head around something if i just keep moving forward. i'm now learning and improving more than ever, and really enjoying the journey!

i've written a couple of things so far that people having enjoyed using, and really hope i continue to do so!
